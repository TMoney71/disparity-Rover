Description:

This file is meant for the first part of the vSLAM algorithm. These steps
are as follows:

- Detect
- Extract
- Match
- Estimate relative camera pose from matched feature points
- Find 3-D locations of the matched feature points
- Refine initial map
- Manage data for initial map and key frames
